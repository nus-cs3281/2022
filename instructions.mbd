# Instructions for Updating this Website

This repo/website is for hosting information about the students in the module, to be maintained by CS3281&2 students collectively. %%It is maintained as a separate repo because students need write access to it.%%

## General Instructions for Updating This Repo

* Clone https://github.com/nus-cs3281/{{ year }} to your Computer.
* Do not force-push.
* Usually, there is no need to create issues or PRs when updating this repo.

While this site uses [MarkBind](https://markbind.org), you can use normal markdown syntax for your updates (MarkBind is compatible with Markdown).

All your files are in a `students/*` sub-folder that is named after you e.g., `students/johnDoe`. Update the `info.md` file in that folder with your basic info. After you have pushed the updated files to the repo, your info should appear automatically in [this page]({{ baseUrl }}/), possibly after a lapse of a few minutes.

If you want to preview the generated site for your changes,
* Install MarkBind
* Use the `markbind serve` command to generate the site locally, and ensure the output is as you intended.

## Updating Your Basic Info

* Update a profile photo named `photo.png` to your folder. %%Naturally, as the purpose of this photo is for others to identify you, you should choose a recent individual photo showing your face clearly (i.e., not too small) -- somewhat similar to a passport photo.%%
* Update other info in the `info.md` file in your folder.


## Updating Your Project Progress

Update the `progress.md` in your folder periodically, at least once every two weeks.

Notes:
* The page is for CS3281&2 work only (i.e., contributions to our own internal projects or work under the CS3282 'External Project' component)
* PR-related contributions: Report only when a PR is merged (or it's finalized in some other way e.g., abandoned)
* Past PRs can be claimed in future weeks, but not the other way around.
* Report each significant achievement in a separate row. You may aggregate multiple minor achievements in to a single row.
