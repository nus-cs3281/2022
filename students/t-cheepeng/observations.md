Planning and execution of Notifications Banner feature. [Link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1F0GfC1ht0RMzjB5q27Ouy1a4nFa44hlvescMTq4ubDo/edit?usp=sharing) to planning documents.

### My Learning Record

As they say, fail to plan, plan to fail. With previous features that were done in past semesters, there were no planning documents that was kept in a central location that everyone had access to. As such, it was difficult to have a reference when coding and developers on the project will be unsure of the requirements or overall architecture of the planned feature. This made it very difficult for developers to all be on the same page and lead to lengthy discussions on Github Issues, PRs, Slack channels that can be resolved with a proper planning phase before execution.

With the introduction of the technical planning document in this semester, everyone working on the feature is clear on the backend design, architecture and frontend pages all at once. This made coding for the CS3281 students much quicker (hopefully) and we could also match their code against the requirements that were laid out in the document.

### Possible practices/tools that can be adopted

Continue to adopt the planning documents in future iterations of CS3281/2
### Suggested areas of improvement

Complete the whole SDLC cycle. That is, include a requirement gathering phase. The current technical document focuses very heavily on the technical aspects of the upgrade. In this iteration, we did not have a formal requirement gathering phase. The requirements laid out were thought of by both CS3281/2 students and approved at a later date. Since requirements are the foundation of any upgrade, they are the most important to get right before technical planning can begin. Having a formal requirement gathering phase (in the form of document or meeting minutes or any other suitable medium) will greatly improve the experience of the technical planning and implementation/testing stage.
