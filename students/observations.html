Mattermost provides three key tools: Channels, a messaging service for direct and group communications, Playbooks, a task manager to plan and run repeatable processes on project situations such as campaigns or incidents, and Boards, a collaborative project manager.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>Mattermost was originally proprietary, but have moved to open-source as the first version was published in 2015. Over the years, it has grown into a big player in its field, competing with proprietary team messaging applications such as Slack.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>The Mattermost codebase is hosted in GitHub as the <a href="https://github.com/mattermost" data-v-7d17494f>Mattermost organization</a>. Some of the key repositories in the organization are <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server" data-v-7d17494f><code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>mattermost-server</code></a>, which handles the core backend functionalities, <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp" data-v-7d17494f><code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>mattermost-webapp</code></a>, which is the web frontend service for the platform, and <a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks" data-v-7d17494f><code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>mattermost-plugin-playbooks</code></a>, which is the full-stack plugin for Playbooks.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-3" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-contributions-3" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Contributions<a href="#my-contributions-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>I took on specifically contributing to the Playbooks plugin as there are many community-friendly issues posted for the plugin. I started out small with editing the data representation and display on user-facing features. My first contribution is updating the options text on a snooze timer for status updates such that it will be displayed as <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>for 60 minutes</code>, and so on with other durations. Although trivial at first glance, it turns out that I need to do more than just literal text substitution. The durations do not only come from literal string representation, but also procedurally generated through the playbook defaults and the user's previous choice of duration. I had to understand how the flow of data between the frontend components first to gather the function that generates the texts for the runtime durations.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>I then picked up an issue to specifically explore the interaction across services when Mattermost is run. The issue asks to match the description field limit on adding and editing a Playbook Task as currently, which seems quite straightforward, but it turns out that these two actions are displayed through vastly different endpoints: the edit task UI is rendered by the plugin webapp service, while the add task UI is rendered by the core webapp service. To discover this, I had to trace from the plugin webapp, to the plugin backend, cross over to the core backend, and end up at the core frontend. Through this, I became acquainted with the way the plugin service interacts with the core service. The knowledge becomes important as the fix is to understand the core backend API parameters and modify the communication body between the plugin backend to the core backend to override the default length limit at core's side.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f><strong data-v-7d17494f>Links to Pull Requests</strong></p> <ul data-v-7d17494f><li data-v-7d17494f><a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/pull/1094" data-v-7d17494f>[GH-19313] Update snooze options text to be &quot;for&quot; duration</a></li> <li data-v-7d17494f><a href="https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-playbooks/pull/1117" data-v-7d17494f>[GH-19356] MM-41063, MM-40565: Increase new task dialog description length</a></li></ul> <h2 id="my-learning-record-3" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-learning-record-3" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-3" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h2> <h3 id="project-workflow" data-v-7d17494f><span id="project-workflow" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>Project Workflow<a href="#project-workflow" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>Community contributors would need to go through the <a href="https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/getting-started/contribution-checklist/" data-v-7d17494f>contribution checklist</a> that outlines what to do and expect out of creating a code contribution.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>Issue management for various areas of the app is done in the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>mattermost-server</code> repository, although some issues may span across multiple repositories. For example, many issues related the Playbook plugin are posted there, even though it actually resides on a different repository. Another instance is that there are issues that require changes in multiple repositories at the same time, such as in <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>mattermost-server</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>mattermost-webapp</code>.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>For the review workflow, in my opinion it is largely the same as MarkBind, in that it is mostly a conventional merge workflow to the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>master</code> branch. Although, one key difference is that there is a sequence of reviews in the approval process, meaning a pull request must be approved by more than one person. I encountered a total of 2-3 reviews, each assuming different positions in the team: the first review is by the Developer reviewer, then the second is by User Experience (UX) reviewer, then the final one is by the Quality Assurance (QA) reviewer.</p> <h3 id="lessons-learned" data-v-7d17494f><span id="lessons-learned" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>Lessons Learned<a href="#lessons-learned" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>I had my first experience on running services with Docker as I have to run the server and the webapp at the same time in order for me to be able to deploy the Playbook plugin. As I am using Windows with Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), there were some setup involved before I can easily run the project, such as integrating Docker from the host OS to the WSL distros, creating links between the systems, and more. It was a good learning experience for me.

The tool is frequently used for managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users and permissions. It also has the ability to directly execute SQL statements. phpMyAdmin is widely used and well documented. This project was started in 1998 and has since become the most popular administrative tool for MySQL databases, especially for web hosting services such as cPanel. It currently has over 1.1k contributors. phpMyAdmin is a mature project with stable and flexible code base.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-4" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-contributions-4" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Contributions<a href="#my-contributions-4" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>For my contributions, I focused on the issues related to the frontend components. I started off by working on a simpler issue, adding the attribute <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>autocomplete=&quot;off&quot;</code> to the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Change Password</code> and <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Login Information</code> forms to fix an issue of <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17163" data-v-7d17494f>having random values being populated into the fields of those forms</a>. For this task, I had to first locate the respective components that contain the forms which was quite straightforward.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>For my next contribution, I worked on fixing a <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17228" data-v-7d17494f>bug related to the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Copy to clipboard</code> feature</a>. The <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Copy to clipboard</code> feature allows users to copy the result from an SQL query. The copied query result will be placed nicely in a table form, in their respective rows and columns. However, when there were <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>NULL</code> values present in the result, the format of the table would be messed up and the copied query result is no longer usable and hard to read. For this task, I had to first locate the component responsible for generating the copied query result. I did this by tracing the code when the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Copy to clipboard</code> button was clicked. Next, I had to investigate why <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>NULL</code> values were causing the formatting of the table to be wrong and I eventually found out that the reason was because they were wrapped in an <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag, which would cause a newline to be generated in their <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>text()</code> method. To resolve this, I added a function to check for the presence of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>&lt;em&gt;</code> tags in the query result. If an <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>&lt;em&gt;</code> tag is found, extract the content out so that the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>text()</code> method will produce the correct formatting.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>For my third contribution, I worked on resolving an issue related to the UI component. For this particular issue, <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17348" data-v-7d17494f>the usage of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag was not working on one of the components and was instead showing up as raw string</a>. For this task, I had to locate the component that contained the relevant code. However, the code was in a generic <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Description</code> file and the issue did not come from the file itself. Then, I tried to find out which particular component used this description and finally discovered that the issue was coming from a method that sanitizes codes. This method causes the input with <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag to be treated as raw string and hence the browser will not process it as a HTML code. To resolve this, I replaced the usage of <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>&lt;code&gt;</code> tag with BBcode, which will return a valid HTML element in the sanitize method.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f><strong data-v-7d17494f>Links to PRs:</strong><br data-v-7d17494f> <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pull/17226" data-v-7d17494f>Set autocomplete off for 'change password' and 'login information' forms #17226</a><br data-v-7d17494f> <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pull/17232" data-v-7d17494f>Fix #17228 - Resolve formatting of copy to clipboard with NULL values #17232</a><br data-v-7d17494f> <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/pull/17350" data-v-7d17494f>Fix #17348 - Resolve formatting of <code data-v-7d17494f> in Preferences &gt; Export #17350</code></a></p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-4" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-learning-record-4" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-4" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>The typical workflow of phpMyAdmin for contributing code can be found in their <a href="https://www.phpmyadmin.net/develop/" data-v-7d17494f>contribution guide</a>. First, fork the repository and create a branch for new changes. Then, once done, open a new pull request from that branch against the relevant branch of the main repository. The pull request should be linked to the relevant issue and should contain a description of the changes. Next, the developers from phpMyAdmin will mark the relevant issue with the label <a href="https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/labels/has-pr" data-v-7d17494f><code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>has-pr</code></a>. The developers will then review the pull request and if satisfied, merge it into the relevant branch. Comparing this to MarkBind's workflow, I think both of them are quite similar. One thing that I find interesting is the labelling of the issue with <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>has-pr</code> if there is already an existing open PR fixing the issue. I think we can also adopt a similar practice in MarkBind so that the issues that already have in-progress PRs can be quickly identified. This can help current and new developers to quickly filter out the issues that already have fixes and focus on issues that need to be fixed. Although GitHub provides the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>linked pull request</code> label, I feel that this is not sufficient as sometimes an issue can require more than 1 pull request or has multiple components. In this case, having an explicit label would allow developers to know if an issue is available to work on.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>In terms of setting up, phpMyAdmin requires PHP, a web server and either a MySQL or MariaDB to run on. A web server is needed so that phpMyAdmin can be accessed through the localhost on the browser. Instead of having to set up each of the required software manually which can be time consuming, especially for configuring Apache and MariaDB, a really quick way to set this up is to use <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html" data-v-7d17494f>XAMPP</a>. XAMPP allows users to quickly set up a PHP development environment which contains Apache, MariaDB, PHP and Perl. It also handles the configuration of these services. The control panel allows each of the services to be started or stopped with a single click. I feel that this tool is really useful for developers that are working on projects that require PHP, Apache or MySQL/MariaDB. XAMPP really helps to streamline the setting up process and speed up the development.</p> <br data-v-7d17494f> <br data-v-7d17494f> <h3 id="project-2-wordpress-gutenberg" data-v-7d17494f><span id="project-2-wordpress-gutenberg" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>Project 2: <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg" data-v-7d17494f>WordPress Gutenberg</a><a href="#project-2-wordpress-gutenberg" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>Gutenberg is a plugin for the popular website builder, WordPress, which is usually included on all installations of WordPress by default.

To resolve this inconsistency, I updated the close panel button in the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Site Editor</code> from the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>X</code> icon to the standardised cancel button.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f><strong data-v-7d17494f>Link to PR:</strong><br data-v-7d17494f> <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/37310" data-v-7d17494f>Site Editor: Update save panel's cancel button from icon to visible text #37310</a></p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-5" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-learning-record-5" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-5" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>The typical workflow for contributing code to Gutenberg can be found in their <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/" data-v-7d17494f>contribution guide</a>. First, a WordPress development environment should be set up so that Gutenberg can be tested locally. Next, for the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/git-workflow/" data-v-7d17494f>git workflow</a>, fork the main repository and then work on the changes in separate branches. Once done, open pull requests from the branches in the forked repository to the main repository's relevant branches. Comparing this to MarkBind's workflow, I think they are both quick similar. With regards to code style and testing, both projects have their own set of rules, MarkBind mainly follows the <a href="https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#airbnb-javascript-style-guide-" data-v-7d17494f>Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide</a> while Gutenberg mainly follows the <a href="http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/" data-v-7d17494f>jQuery JavaScript Style Guide</a>. Gutenberg has some extra testing components such as end-to-end and performance tests, which MarkBind currently lacks but they are being considered currently in <a href="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/1798" data-v-7d17494f>#1798</a> and <a href="https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/1544" data-v-7d17494f>#1544</a>.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>One thing I find interesting is setting up the test environment for testing the project. To test out WordPress plugins, a WordPress installation is required. Setting up a WordPress environment can be time consuming and tedious. One particular tool that WordPress has provided is a development package called <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env" data-v-7d17494f><code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>wp-env</code></a>. This package allows developers to easily set up a local WordPress environment for building and testing plugins and themes. It relies on the use of <a href="https://www.docker.com/" data-v-7d17494f>Docker</a> with pre-built images that contain a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP) and WordPress. Then, it pulls in the plugin or theme project folder into the Docker instance and serve it through the localhost. Developers will then be able to test their plugins and themes by accessing the WordPress instance through the browser on localhost. I think this method of using pre-built images on Docker can be really useful for developers to quickly start up development environments to test out their applications in different operating systems. For MarkBind, since it is mainly used on web browsers, there are instances which the output result is different when used on different web browsers and operating systems, especially for the styling of the components. I feel it may be a good idea if we can set up a few environments for MarkBind's developers to test out their codes in different operating systems and browsers. For instance, a Windows user currently will not be able to serve a site in Safari to see how it will run and vice versa. There are online services such as <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/" data-v-7d17494f>BrowserStack</a> and <a href="https://www.browsera.com/" data-v-7d17494f>Browsera</a> which provide cloud servers to run Windows and MacOS to test out web services in the different browsers. However, most of these services are not free. One possible workaround that MarkBind developers can do is to run Windows and MacOS in VirtualBox. Usually, the images provided for MacOS will not be the latest version but it can at least give the developers something to work with. We can consider including a short guide on how the VMs can be set up and used for testing in our developer guide.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>Gutenberg project also has the practice of prefixing the pull request's title with the component name that the pull request is working on. For example, if the pull request changes something on the <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Site Editor</code> component, then the title will be <code class="hljs inline no-lang" data-v-7d17494f>Site Editor: ...</code>. I find this rather useful as it allows reviewers to quickly tell which component to look out for in that particular pull request and at the same time limit the developer to not make unrelated changes in that pull request. I believe MarkBind can also possibly adopt this practice of prefixing the pull request title and add this requirement to the guideline.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <h1 id="reposense"><span id="reposense" class="anchor"></span>RepoSense<a href="#reposense" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor"></a></h1> <div class="alert box-container alert-default" data-v-7d17494f><!----> <div class="header-and-body" data-v-7d17494f><!----> <div class="box-body-wrapper" data-v-7d17494f><!----> <!----> <div class="contents" data-v-7d17494f><h2 id="hsu-zhong-jun" data-v-7d17494f><span id="hsu-zhong-jun" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>HSU ZHONG JUN<a href="#hsu-zhong-jun" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h2> <div data-v-7d17494f><h3 id="project-foo-2" data-v-7d17494f><span id="project-foo-2" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>Project: Foo<a href="#project-foo-2" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>Give an intro to the project here ...</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-6" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-contributions-6" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Contributions<a href="#my-contributions-6" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>Give a description of your contributions, including links to relevant PRs</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-6" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-learning-record-6" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-6" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>Give tools/technologies you learned here.

From my understanding of memory leaks, it can usually be solved by changing a single line. However I underestimated how hard it was to determine which line it was. Godot uses a custom garbage collection mechanism to track object dependencies, which allows one to free objects when all pointers to them are freed. The memory leak can hence easily be inferred to be caused by a circular dependency, in which the ancestor of some object is itself. As a result, the object can never be completely dereferenced and hence freed. The issue can be fixed by informing children about who exactly is referencing them, to prevent objects from tracking self references. There was already a function to do this, but it was not applied to all objects. Unfortunately, I was unable to completely resolve the issue.</p> <h3 id="my-learning-record-7" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-learning-record-7" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Learning Record<a href="#my-learning-record-7" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <h4 id="workflow-in-godot" data-v-7d17494f><span id="workflow-in-godot" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>Workflow in Godot<a href="#workflow-in-godot" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h4> <p data-v-7d17494f>Pull Requests get reviewed by Godot developers and need to pass checks via Github Actions to ensure a stable system after the Pull Request has been merged.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>Credits: <a href="https://github.com/godotengine/godot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md" data-v-7d17494f>Contributing Guide</a></p> <h4 id="lessons-learnt-from-contributing-to-godot" data-v-7d17494f><span id="lessons-learnt-from-contributing-to-godot" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>Lessons Learnt from contributing to Godot<a href="#lessons-learnt-from-contributing-to-godot" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h4> <p data-v-7d17494f>The preferred IDE for working on C++ is Visual Studio.

We’re mostly a bunch of student developers with little experience, and our project is much more product-focused.
We could definitely improve our code review practices, which are optional at the moment (sometimes we even push directly to the main branch).
We could also improve on our public-facing works, such as READMEs and documentation,

The development team consists of 4 CS3281 students, and the entire project is a full-stack project covering everything from back-end API, logic and database design to front-end UI and UX. The entire feature is fully tested, including front-end and back-end unit tests, as well as end-to-end tests.</p> <p data-v-7d17494f>TEAMMATES has come a long way, but there wasn't a way for us to reach out to our users besides sending emails. Even with emails, the original problem is still not solved - we want users to feel more connected with TEAMMATES, to know what is going in TEAMMATES. Hence, the Notification feature was born. With the new release on 16 April 2022, TEAMMATES users around the world will be able to login to the TEAMMATES portal and see the first notification from us. The notification system will allow the users to mark notifications as read, and browse through the history of notifications on a dedicated user notifactions page. For returning users, this is important as it gets them updated on how has TEAMMATES improved over the past months or years.Perhaps they will once again fall in love with TEAMMATES for the new features hardworking developers at TEAMMATES has brought to the platform 😃. On the other hand, with the new admin notifications page, the admin will have complete control over how the notifications will be displayed to the user, be it the style of the notification or who the notification is targeted at.</p> <h3 id="my-contributions-11" data-v-7d17494f><span id="my-contributions-11" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>My Contributions<a href="#my-contributions-11" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h3> <p data-v-7d17494f>My contributions as a mentor includes giving general directions, assessing blockers and prioritising objectives to ensure that goals are met within the given deadline.

Slack is our asynchronous mode of communication and I had to say that it has been an effective platform for raising quick issues, discussing possible solutions or even pinging each other for reviews. However, I do also realise that there are limitations with this kind of text-based communication, one of them being that it can be difficult to make sure that everyone is on the same page, without being able to see them or hear them. We can only assume that everyone has read the message and understood the importance of it or the intent behind it. In constrast, physical or online meetings allow for a continuous stream of conversation between parties to work out misconceptions and make things crystal clear. This can help to avoid miscommunications which otherwise could delay milestone objectives. On the other hand, face-to-face or online meetings also has its caveats, in that team members may feel shy to voice out or have yet to digest the conversation. Hence, a secondary asynchronous mode of communication via Slack is still important to &quot;patch the holes&quot;.</p> <h4 id="as-a-reviewer" data-v-7d17494f><span id="as-a-reviewer" class="anchor" data-v-7d17494f></span>As a reviewer<a href="#as-a-reviewer" onclick="event.stopPropagation()" class="fa fa-anchor" data-v-7d17494f></a></h4> <p data-v-7d17494f>As a reviewer, I realise the many tendencies of developers to go with their own style or way of doing things. It is quite natural for different people to approach things differently. While most of the code may not be wrong or affect correctness, in a software engineering project this would lead to a mess and it will present a lot of difficulties for other developers who see the code for the first time. Hence, while understanding the design and architecture of a project is important, making sure that new developers understand the importance of the coding standard is equally important. I have realised the importance of &quot;nitpicks&quot; to slowly adjust these tendencies and allow new developers to write code that do not stand out for the wrong reasons in the codebase. I have also observed that it takes time to push cleaner and more standard-consistent PRs, and as a reviewer, telling the &quot;why&quot; instead of stating the &quot;what&quot; when giving reviews is important for allowing new developers to learn.</p></div></div> <!----></div></div></div> <i id="scroll-top-button" onclick="handleScrollTop()" aria-hidden="true" class="fa fa-arrow-circle-up fa-lg d-print-none"></i></div> <nav id="page-nav" class="fixed-header-padding" data-v-e8c82f88><div class="nav-component slim-scroll" data-v-e8c82f88><nav id="mb-page-nav" class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 small no-flex-wrap" data-v-e8c82f88><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#observations-from-external-projects" data-v-e8c82f88>Observations from External Projects‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#catcher" data-v-e8c82f88>CATcher‎</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e8c82f88><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#low-jun-kai-sean" data-v-e8c82f88>LOW JUN KAI, SEAN‎</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#project-nusmods" data-v-e8c82f88>Project: NUSMods‎</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e8c82f88><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#my-contributions" data-v-e8c82f88>My Contributions‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#my-learning-record" data-v-e8c82f88>My Learning Record‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#ding-yuchen" data-v-e8c82f88>DING YUCHEN‎</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#markbind" data-v-e8c82f88>MarkBind‎</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e8c82f88><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#ryo-chandra-putra-armanda" data-v-e8c82f88>RYO CHANDRA PUTRA ARMANDA‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#project-mattermost" data-v-e8c82f88>Project: Mattermost‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#my-learning-record-3" data-v-e8c82f88>My Learning Record‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#jonah-tan-jun-zi" data-v-e8c82f88>JONAH TAN JUN ZI‎</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#reposense" data-v-e8c82f88>RepoSense‎</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e8c82f88><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#hsu-zhong-jun" data-v-e8c82f88>HSU ZHONG JUN‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#chan-ger-hean" data-v-e8c82f88>CHAN GER HEAN‎</a></nav> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#teammates" data-v-e8c82f88>TEAMMATES‎</a> <nav class="nav nav-pills flex-column my-0 nested no-flex-wrap" data-v-e8c82f88><a class="nav-link py-1" href="#tan-chee-peng" data-v-e8c82f88>TAN CHEE PENG‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#mo-zongran" data-v-e8c82f88>MO ZONGRAN‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#lim-zi-wei" data-v-e8c82f88>LIM ZI WEI‎</a> <a class="nav-link py-1" href="#li-jianhan" data-v-e8c82f88>LI JIANHAN‎</a></nav> <!----></nav></div> <!----></nav></div> <footer><div class="text-center"><p>[<strong>This site was generated using <img src="https://markbind.org/favicon.ico" width="25"> <a href="https://markbind.org/">MarkBind 3.1.1</a></strong> on Tue, Apr 26, 2022, 2:33:55 PM UTC]<br> <span class="dimmed"><small><small>favicon.ico of this site was made by <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/authors/smashicons" title="Smashicons">Smashicons</a> from <a href="https://www.flaticon.com/" title="Flaticon">www.flaticon.com</a> is licensed by <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" title="Creative Commons BY 3.0" target="_blank">CC 3.0 BY</a></small></small></span></p></div></footer></div>
