## Summary

Throughout the semester, I took on the responsibility as one of the project mentors and maintainers of MarkBind. My works are reviewing incoming pull requests, managing issues, and ensuring the project is up to date with current standards.

I have learned a lot of being a mentor and a maintainer of an established project. The mentorship has taught me how to approach and guide prospective contributors to the project, from giving guidance on issues and blockers to giving good feedbacks. As the contributors gain experience in making contributions, I also gain experience from responding queries and reading up best practices online (for instance reading [How to Do Code Reviews Like a Human](https://mtlynch.io/human-code-reviews-1/) is really helpful in structuring my reviews).

Being a maintainer, I discovered there is a lot more on managing a project than just features, from keeping up with the current dependencies and security issues to improving the developer and project workflows as a whole. On this end, I have also pushed some work aside from reviews, most notably the adoption of TypeScript into the backend codebase. I hope that these small steps continue into increased quality and security of the MarkBind project.

Overall, I am grateful with the experience of managing an open-source project. The knowledge that I have learned is certainly applicable not just for open-source projects, but also for development management in general.

## Contributions

### Pull Request Reviews

Here are the pull requests that I have reviewed or followed up on since I become a project maintainer. Since most of the nature of the pull requests are incremental and thus require continual reviews, I recorded only the date when I leave my first review next to the pull request below.
