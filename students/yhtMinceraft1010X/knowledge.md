### Git Cloning/Windows Credential Manager

These are the pointers that I learned while testing out git cloning for private repositories:
* When cloning private repositories for the first time, access is determined by Github account credentials.
* These credentials are stored on Windows Credential Manager, which allows cloning private repositories again without having to log in.
* The stored credentials can be deleted. In that case, for the next private repo cloning attempt, the credentials have to be keyed in again.

### Java Date/Time APIs

Below is a table comparing some Java 8 date/time APIs that I worked with in [PR #1625](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1625):
