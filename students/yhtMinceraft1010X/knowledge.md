### Git Cloning/Windows Credential Manager

These are the pointers that I learned while testing out git cloning for private repositories:
* When cloning private repositories for the first time, access is determined by Github account credentials.
* These credentials are stored on Windows Credential Manager, which allows cloning private repositories again without having to log in.
* The stored credentials can be deleted. In that case, for the next private repo cloning attempt, the credentials have to be keyed in again.
