Slack is our asynchronous mode of communication and I had to say that it has been an effective platform for raising quick issues, discussing possible solutions or even pinging each other for reviews. However, I do also realise that there are limitations with this kind of text-based communication, one of them being that it can be difficult to make sure that everyone is on the same page, without being able to see them or hear them. We can only assume that everyone has read the message and understood the importance of it or the intent behind it. In constrast, physical or online meetings allow for a continuous stream of conversation between parties to work out misconceptions and make things crystal clear. This can help to avoid miscommunications which otherwise could delay milestone objectives. On the other hand, face-to-face or online meetings also has its caveats, in that team members may feel shy to voice out or have yet to digest the conversation.

Hence, while understanding the design and architecture of a project is important, making sure that new developers understand the importance of the coding standard is equally important. I have realised the importance of \"nitpicks\" to slowly adjust these tendencies and allow new developers to write code that do not stand out for the wrong reasons in the codebase.
