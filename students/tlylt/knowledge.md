### Creating & Publishing a NPM package
While I use packages from NPM all the time, working on MarkBind has motivated me to create and publish a NPM package from start to finish.
I chose to create a plugin for Markdown-it, a Markdown parser that is used by MarkBind in the process of converting Markdown to HTML. In 
the process of creating the plugin, I followed a tutorial by Kent C. Dodds and explored a few development tools such as 
- mocha and chai for testing, 
- semantic-release and commitizen for releasing the package, 
- Babel for transpiling the code, 
- Github Actions for automating the update.
