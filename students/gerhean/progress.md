# Summary

In summary, this semester for CS3281, the main contributions were attempting to upgrade frontend.
I suggested using `typescript` to make the code more readable.

I gave my review for all frontend related PRs.

For [EP], I made a few PR to `Godot`, detailed in the external projects section.
