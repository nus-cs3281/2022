### Project 1: [phpMyAdmin](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin)

phpMyAdmin is an open-source tool, written in PHP, to provide a user-friendly and intuitive web interface to handle the administration and operations of MySQL or MariaDB databases. The tool is frequently used for managing databases, tables, columns, relations, indexes, users and permissions. It also has the ability to directly execute SQL statements. phpMyAdmin is widely used and well documented. This project was started in 1998 and has since become the most popular administrative tool for MySQL databases, especially for web hosting services such as cPanel. It currently has over 1.1k contributors. phpMyAdmin is a mature project with stable and flexible code base.

### My Contributions

For my contributions, I focused on the issues related to the frontend components. I started off by working on a simpler issue, adding the attribute `autocomplete="off"` to the `Change Password` and `Login Information` forms to fix an issue of [having random values being populated into the fields of those forms](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17163). For this task, I had to first locate the respective components that contain the forms which was quite straightforward.

For my next contribution, I worked on fixing a [bug related to the `Copy to clipboard` feature](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17228). The `Copy to clipboard` feature allows users to copy the result from an SQL query. The copied query result will be placed nicely in a table form, in their respective rows and columns. However, when there were `NULL` values present in the result, the format of the table would be messed up and the copied query result is no longer usable and hard to read. For this task, I had to first locate the component responsible for generating the copied query result. I did this by tracing the code when the `Copy to clipboard` button was clicked. Next, I had to investigate why `NULL` values were causing the formatting of the table to be wrong and I eventually found out that the reason was because they were wrapped in an `<em>` tag, which would cause a newline to be generated in their `text()` method. To resolve this, I added a function to check for the presence of `<em>` tags in the query result. If an `<em>` tag is found, extract the content out so that the `text()` method will produce the correct formatting.

For my third contribution, I worked on resolving an issue related to the UI component. For this particular issue, [the usage of `<code>` tag was not working on one of the components and was instead showing up as raw string](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/issues/17348). For this task, I had to locate the component that contained the relevant code. However, the code was in a generic `Description` file and the issue did not come from the file itself. Then, I tried to find out which particular component used this description and finally discovered that the issue was coming from a method that sanitizes codes. This method causes the input with `<code>` tag to be treated as raw string and hence the browser will not process it as a HTML code. To resolve this, I replaced the usage of `<code>` tag with BBcode, which will return a valid HTML element in the sanitize method.

### My Learning Record

The typical workflow of phpMyAdmin for contributing code can be found in their [contribution guide](https://www.phpmyadmin.net/develop/). First, fork the repository and create a branch for new changes. Then, once done, open a new pull request from that branch against the relevant branch of the main repository. The pull request should be linked to the relevant issue and should contain a description of the changes. Next, the developers from phpMyAdmin will mark the relevant issue with the label [`has-pr`](https://github.com/phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin/labels/has-pr). The developers will then review the pull request and if satisfied, merge it into the relevant branch. Comparing this to MarkBind's workflow, I think both of them are quite similar. One thing that I find interesting is the labelling of the issue with `has-pr` if there is already an existing open PR fixing the issue. I think we can also adopt a similar practice in MarkBind so that the issues that already have in-progress PRs can be quickly identified. This can help current and new developers to quickly filter out the issues that already have fixes and focus on issues that need to be fixed. Although GitHub provides the `linked pull request` label, I feel that this is not sufficient as sometimes an issue can require more than 1 pull request or has multiple components. In this case, having an explicit label would allow developers to know if an issue is available to work on.

In terms of setting up, phpMyAdmin requires PHP, a web server and either a MySQL or MariaDB to run on. A web server is needed so that phpMyAdmin can be accessed through the localhost on the browser. Instead of having to set up each of the required software manually which can be time consuming, especially for configuring Apache and MariaDB, a really quick way to set this up is to use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html). XAMPP allows users to quickly set up a PHP development environment which contains Apache, MariaDB, PHP and Perl. It also handles the configuration of these services. The control panel allows each of the services to be started or stopped with a single click. I feel that this tool is really useful for developers that are working on projects that require PHP, Apache or MySQL/MariaDB. XAMPP really helps to streamline the setting up process and speed up the development.

### Project 2: [WordPress Gutenberg](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg)

Gutenberg is a plugin for the popular website builder, WordPress, which is usually included on all installations of WordPress by default. Gutenberg is a block editor tool that allows WordPress developers to customise the pages and posts in a modular approach. Gutenberg can create blocks that contain elements such as image gallery, paragraph, shortcodes, custom HTML and many more. Gutenberg is an open-source tool managed by WordPress. It currently has over 19 million active installations and more than 800 contributors.

### My Contributions

I contributed to the project by fixing an [issue related to the consistency of the UI component in the `Site Editor` feature](https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/29886). Previously, in the save panel of the `Site Editor`, the close panel button is an `X` icon whereas the close panel button on the `Post Editor` is a cancel button. To resolve this inconsistency, I updated the close panel button in the `Site Editor` from the `X` icon to the standardised cancel button.

### My Learning Record

The typical workflow for contributing code to Gutenberg can be found in their [contribution guide](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/). First, a WordPress development environment should be set up so that Gutenberg can be tested locally. Next, for the [git workflow](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/contributors/code/git-workflow/), fork the main repository and then work on the changes in separate branches. Once done, open pull requests from the branches in the forked repository to the main repository's relevant branches. Comparing this to MarkBind's workflow, I think they are both quick similar. With regards to code style and testing, both projects have their own set of rules, MarkBind mainly follows the [Airbnb JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript#airbnb-javascript-style-guide-) while Gutenberg mainly follows the [jQuery JavaScript Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/). Gutenberg has some extra testing components such as end-to-end and performance tests, which MarkBind currently lacks but they are being considered currently in [#1798](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/1798) and [#1544](https://github.com/MarkBind/markbind/issues/1544).

One thing I find interesting is setting up the test environment for testing the project. To test out WordPress plugins, a WordPress installation is required. Setting up a WordPress environment can be time consuming and tedious. One particular tool that WordPress has provided is a development package called [`wp-env`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wordpress/env). This package allows developers to easily set up a local WordPress environment for building and testing plugins and themes. It relies on the use of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) with pre-built images that contain a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, and PHP) and WordPress. Then, it pulls in the plugin or theme project folder into the Docker instance and serve it through the localhost. Developers will then be able to test their plugins and themes by accessing the WordPress instance through the browser on localhost. I think this method of using pre-built images on Docker can be really useful for developers to quickly start up development environments to test out their applications in different operating systems. For MarkBind, since it is mainly used on web browsers, there are instances which the output result is different when used on different web browsers and operating systems, especially for the styling of the components. I feel it may be a good idea if we can set up a few environments for MarkBind's developers to test out their codes in different operating systems and browsers. For instance, a Windows user currently will not be able to serve a site in Safari to see how it will run and vice versa. There are online services such as [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) and [Browsera](https://www.browsera.com/) which provide cloud servers to run Windows and MacOS to test out web services in the different browsers. However, most of these services are not free. One possible workaround that MarkBind developers can do is to run Windows and MacOS in VirtualBox. Usually, the images provided for MacOS will not be the latest version but it can at least give the developers something to work with. We can consider including a short guide on how the VMs can be set up and used for testing in our developer guide.

Gutenberg project also has the practice of prefixing the pull request's title with the component name that the pull request is working on. For example, if the pull request changes something on the `Site Editor` component, then the title will be `Site Editor: ...`. I find this rather useful as it allows reviewers to quickly tell which component to look out for in that particular pull request and at the same time limit the developer to not make unrelated changes in that pull request. I believe MarkBind can also possibly adopt this practice of prefixing the pull request title and add this requirement to the guideline.
