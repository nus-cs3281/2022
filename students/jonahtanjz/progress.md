## Learning points

For this semester and the previous semester, I have mostly worked on reviewing PRs made by new contributors. Being a mentor has taught me quite a few important things. I have become more familiar with the codebase as I have to better understand the inner workings of the features before testing and revieweing the PRs. I also got to experience the project management side such as making decisions and guiding new contributors.

I have also made some pull requests in the current and previous semesters. For the previous semester, one of my major contribution to the project is to complete the revamp of the mobile navbar that was leftover from CS3281. There were also a few other bug fixes and enhancements that I have worked on along the way.

Overall, this entire process has led me to better understand and appreciate working in an open-source project. I have a better understanding of team work as well as project management. I have learnt to give meaningful and constructuve feedbacks through PR reviews and issue discussions. I thoroughly enjoyed this process and will continue to contribute to MarkBind after this semester! :)
